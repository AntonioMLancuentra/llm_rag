Proof of Concept (PoC) of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) simple system

Bullet points, to trim later:

Technical Focus
"Secure Local RAG System with Privacy-First Architecture"
Proof of Concept implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation using local-only processing
Features network isolation, user session guardrails, and confidential data protection
Built with Ollama models and local vector storage for complete data sovereignty

Business/Security Focus
"Enterprise-Ready Local RAG: Zero-Trust Knowledge Base System"

Privacy-preserving document intelligence system preventing data leakage and cross-user contamination
Implements air-gapped RAG architecture for sensitive organizational knowledge management
Demonstrates secure AI deployment without external API dependencies

Comprehensive Description
"Isolated RAG System: Secure Knowledge Retrieval with Local AI Models"

End-to-end RAG implementation combining local file processing and web content ingestion
Features multi-layer security: network-level blocking, input sanitization, and session isolation
Utilizes Ollama granite-MOE for generation and nomic-embed-text for embeddings
Designed for environments requiring strict data confidentiality and user privacy

Simple but Descriptive
"Local RAG System with Built-in Security Controls"

Retrieval-Augmented Generation system using only local models and storage
Includes firewall protection and user isolation features
Processes both local documents and web content for knowledge base creation
